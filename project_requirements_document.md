# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

This project is about building a multi-functional website that acts as a central hub for non-employee, contingent workforce management. The site’s main purpose is to provide updated regulatory information displayed in an easy-to-read table format alongside separate pages for country-specific details. It will also host a rich repository of HR best practices, downloadable templates, and consultancy resources. Ultimately, the website is meant to support HR, Procurement, and legal teams by offering a go-to reference for all matters related to non-employee workforce management while simultaneously promoting freelancing consultancy services.

In addition to the content hub, the platform will integrate an AI Agent that functions as a contingent workforce consultant. This agent will be able to answer questions based on the website’s knowledge base and even perform advanced functions like resume screening, sourcing, interview scheduling, and onboarding. The site is built to be easily updated—either manually via an admin panel or with automated tools—to ensure that regulatory content remains current on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. Success is defined by a professional, user-friendly experience for both public visitors and non-technical admins, making the site the leading resource in its domain.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Public multi-page website featuring:

    *   Dedicated pages for country-specific contingent workforce regulations.
    *   A comprehensive tabular view of all regulations segmented by country.
    *   Sections for HR best practices containing downloadable templates and case studies.
    *   An AI Agent to handle queries related to contingent workforce management, drawing on both site articles and regulatory content.

*   A robust admin panel with:

    *   Role-based access (e.g., editor and administrator) to manage, add, edit, or remove articles, pages, images, and regulations.
    *   Integrated automated tool support for monthly/bi-monthly regulatory updates.
    *   Secure user authentication including two-factor authentication.

*   Integration mechanism for third-party tools such as email marketing services, CRM systems, and social media.

*   Provision for future localization and translation features (Mandarin, Japanese, Bahasa Indonesia).

*   Support for user engagement via contact forms, feedback options, and clear call-to-action channels to promote freelancing services.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Full automation of advanced hiring processes (e.g., complete resume screening and vendor system updates) as the more advanced AI Agent is considered a long-term, incremental evolution.
*   Initial full-scale multi-language support; language translations will be provisioned but only implemented in the future.
*   Complex multiple security roles beyond simple admin and editor functions (beyond two-factor authentication and standard role management).
*   Heavy custom integrations with third-party services at launch—only the provisioning for connections is required.

## 3. User Flow

A new visitor to the website will start their journey on a professionally designed homepage that clearly explains the site’s purpose as a hub for contingent workforce management. Upon landing, they’ll see clear navigation links to different sections: one for viewing international and country-specific regulations through a comprehensive table and another dedicated area for HR best practices, including downloadable templates and detailed articles. Visitors can easily click on a country name from the table to drill down into detailed regulatory pages with additional context and updates.

For users requiring personalized interactions, a built-in AI-powered chatbot is available to answer queries related to non-employee workforce management and provide consultancy-like insights. Meanwhile, external visitors interested in the freelancing consultancy service can easily reach out through integrated contact forms and feedback options placed throughout the site. When an admin logs in via the secure admin panel—protected by two-factor authentication—they are taken to a user-friendly backend interface where they can manage content effortlessly, update the regulatory tables, add new pages, and upload new images or articles using the provided tools.

    *   Ensure compliance with data protection and international standards where applicable.
    *   Secure API communications especially when integrating third-party tools.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The AI Agent functionalities will initially rely on provided JSON data from the Manus website. It is assumed that this data is comprehensive and structured well.
*   The administrative tools must remain highly usable for non-technical users, inferring minimal complexity and clear language in the interface.
*   It is assumed that the target audience primarily speaks English initially with provisions in place for future language translations.
*   Availability of V0 by Vercel for rapid frontend component building and its compatibility with the chosen tech stack is assumed.
*   The automation tool for regulatory updates must be straightforward and low-maintenance for users with little coding background.
*   Certain advanced AI functionalities (such as full resume screening and vendor management system updates) are recognized as long-term “nice-to-have” features rather than immediate requirements.
*   The project assumes a stable internet connection and standard hosting capabilities to meet performance and reliability needs.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Data Consistency & Accuracy:**\
    The integrity of the regular regulatory updates depends on the automated tool’s ability to crawl and parse data from various websites. Potential issues include format changes on source sites or API rate limits during data fetching. A mitigation idea is to implement error logging and alerts for manual intervention when data inconsistencies are detected.
*   **AI Agent Training & Integration:**\
    Integrating an AI Agent that functions reliably as a contingent workforce consultant can encounter challenges such as insufficient training data or changing regulatory language. A phased approach is recommended where the initial chatbot focuses on answering queries based on a solid knowledge base, and more advanced functionalities are added gradually.
*   **User Authentication Security:**\
    While two-factor authentication improves security, it can also introduce user friction. Detailed user guides and fallback options should be implemented to ensure users do not get locked out.
*   **Scalability for Localization:**\
    Although initial language support focuses on English, the future integration of multi-language support might require additional frameworks or backend changes. Provisions in the data model and UI design should be made to accommodate translations without significant rework.
*   **Third-Party Integration Challenges:**\
    Connecting to external tools (such as CRM systems or email marketing services) might face compatibility issues. Building around a flexible API layer can help in mitigating these challenges.
