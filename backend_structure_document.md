# Backend Structure Document

This document provides an overview of the backend setup for our contingent workforce management website. It is written in everyday language to ensure that even non-technical readers can understand how the backend is structured. Below are the details, from the overall architecture to security, monitoring, and maintenance.

## 1. Backend Architecture

Our backend is built using modern, scalable, and maintainable design principles. Here’s an overview:

- **Framework & Language:**
  - Node.js is our primary runtime environment, enabling fast performance and non-blocking operations.

- **Design Patterns:**
  - We follow modular design principles, which means that different functions (such as handling API requests, file uploads, and database operations) are managed in separate modules. This makes updating and expanding functionality easier.

- **Scalability:**
  - The system is designed to support growth in users and content. We can add more servers or scale up our Node.js deployment as needed. The architecture supports horizontal scaling, meaning more machines can run parts of the application concurrently.

- **Maintainability:**
  - Clear separation of concerns and modular coding practices make it easier to update and fix parts of the system without affecting the whole application.

- **Performance:**
  - Our asynchronous processing in Node.js, caching strategies, and use of a high-performance SQL database ensure that the backend is responsive, even under load.

## 2. Database Management

Our database is a critical part of storing and retrieving our application’s data. Below are the details:

- **Database Technology:**
  - We are using **PostgreSQL** as our primary SQL database.

- **Data Types and Structure:**
  - **Relational Data:** Information such as user details, regulatory updates, and content items (articles, templates, etc.) is organized in tables with clearly defined relationships.
  - **Media Files:** AWS S3 is used for storing large files like images and downloadable resources. The database stores references (URLs) to these files.

- **Data Management Practices:**
  - Regular backups and automated scripts ensure that data can be recovered or migrated if needed.
  - Indexing is used on key columns to speed up searches and access, ensuring a responsive application even with an increasing amount of data.

## 3. Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database schema is designed to capture the essential elements of our application. Here’s a human-readable outline:

- **Users:** Stores account details (email, password hash, roles, two-factor authentication details, etc.).
- **Articles & Regulations:** Tables for storing content for regulatory information, HR best practices, downloadable templates, etc. Each record includes title, content, country (if applicable), and publication dates.
- **Admin Panel Data:** Dedicated tables for managing admin users and logging their actions for security purposes.
- **Media References:** A table that stores references to media files stored in AWS S3 (storing file URL, file type, etc.).

For example, here’s an SQL outline for some tables (in PostgreSQL dialect):

-- Users Table:
• id: Primary key, unique identifier for each user
• email: Unique email address
• password_hash: Encrypted password
• role: Role assigned (admin, editor, etc.)
• two_factor_enabled: Boolean value signaling 2FA status

-- Articles Table:
• id: Primary key
• title: Title of the article
• content: Body text
• country: Country identifier for regulation-specific articles
• published_date: Date when the article was published

-- Media References Table:
• id: Primary key
• file_url: Link to the media file in AWS S3
• file_type: Mime type of the file (e.g., image/png, application/pdf)

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

Our application uses RESTful API design to ensure clear communication between the frontend and backend. Important points include:

- **RESTful APIs:**
  - Endpoints follow standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for clear and predictable actions.

- **Key Endpoints:**
  - **/api/articles:** Retrieve, add, update, or delete regulatory information and HR best practices articles.
  - **/api/users:** Manage user authentication, registration, and profile updates.
  - **/api/admin:** Endpoints strictly for admin functionalities like content management and regulating updates.
  - **/api/media:** Handle file uploads and retrievals, with media stored in AWS S3.
  - **/api/ai-agent:** A dedicated endpoint to interact with the custom AI Agent that provides contingent workforce consulting.

- **JSON Format:**
  - Communication between the frontend and backend uses JSON, which is a simple and readable data format.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

Our backend is hosted on scalable and reliable infrastructure:

- **Cloud Provider:**
  - We are leveraging cloud-based hosting, particularly on services like AWS. This includes the use of AWS services for compute, storage, and network management.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Reliability:** AWS provides robust uptime and automated backups.
  - **Scalability:** Easy provision of additional resources as user demand grows.
  - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay-as-you-go model helps manage expenses effectively, ensuring high performance at a controlled cost.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

Several components work together to ensure the backend is fast, secure, and reliable:

- **Load Balancers:** Distribute traffic evenly across servers to prevent overload on any single machine.
- **Caching Mechanisms:** Caching frequently accessed data reduces the load on the database and speeds up content delivery.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Although primarily used for the frontend, CDNs can also help deliver static assets, ensuring quick load times globally.
- **AWS Components:**
  - **S3:** Used for storing media files.
  - **EC2 or Lambda:** Compute resources that run our Node.js server.

## 7. Security Measures

Security is a top priority. Here are the measures we have in place to protect data and secure operations:

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for secure, stateless user sessions.
  - **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enhances login security, especially for admin panel access.
  - Role-based access control ensures that users (admin, editor) only have access to the appropriate parts of the system.

- **Data Encryption:**
  - Sensitive information is encrypted both in storage and during transmission (using HTTPS).

- **Regular Audits:**
  - Logs and administrative changes are tracked to detect and respond to any suspicious activity.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

To keep the system running smoothly, we use a combination of tools and practices:

- **Monitoring Tools:**
  - Application performance monitoring tools (like New Relic or AWS CloudWatch) track the health and performance of the backend, alerting us to any issues.
  - Log management tools are used to track errors and resolve issues quickly.

- **Maintenance Strategies:**
  - Regular updates to the system ensure that security patches and performance improvements are applied.
  - Automated backups and regular integrity checks of the database and media store minimize downtime and data loss.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

To summarize, our backend is designed to support a robust, scalable, and secure platform for managing a contingent workforce. Key takeaways include:

- **Scalability & Performance:** The use of Node.js, PostgreSQL, and scalable AWS services ensures that the system performs well even under increased load.
- **Modular and Maintainable Architecture:** A clear separation of functionalities guarantees that we can update and maintain different parts of the system independently.
- **Security:** With JWT, Two-Factor Authentication, and encryption practices, user data and administrative functions are well protected.
- **Ease of Use:** The backend is tied to a user-friendly admin panel tailored for non-technical users, making content management effortless. This is complemented by an AI Agent that can serve as a smart consulting tool.

Overall, the designed backend structure not only supports the current features but is also built with future enhancements in mind, such as additional language support and further integration with third-party services.

This comprehensive structure ensures that our website will effectively manage and deliver content, support a secure environment for both users and administrators, and offer scalable solutions to meet growing demands.
